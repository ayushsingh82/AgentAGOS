# AgentAGOS

AgentAGOS is an advanced AI-powered agent that mimics human-like speech and engages in live streaming based on prompts provided by users. It includes a live chat feature that allows real-time interaction during streams. Additionally, we are developing our native token, **$AGOS**, to power the ecosystem.

Create agents that speak and understand multiple languages fluently. Real-time translation across conversations.

🔌 **Integrate Anywhere**  
Integrate voice across different applications and social channels.

🧠 **Emotional Intelligence**  
Agents that adapt tone and responses based on conversation context.

🔄 **Memory Systems**

- **Custom Token ($AGOS)**: A native token that will be integrated into the ecosystem for various utilities.

## Upcoming Features
